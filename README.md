Gathered Correspondences
=========================

Occasionally, I write ridiculous long emails to people about things I'm working on. I put a lot less effort into figuring out how to explain them, polishing them, and illustrating them than I do into my blog posts. Because of this they are much much easier to write.

While not at the level of my blog posts, I think they're often quite valuable.

With people's consent, I'm also including some responses.


* [Conditional Computation Ideas](2013-11-Conditional-Computation.md) (November 24, 2013) -- Describes a number of ideas regarding "conditional" neural networks. They were theoretically somewhat promising, but initial experiments were much less so. Yoshua Bengio provides some comments.

* [Generalized Convolutional Neural Networks](2013-11-GeneralizedConvNets.md) (November 18, 2013) -- A long email outlining ideas for generalizing convolutional neural networks using groups, categories, algebraic data structures and more. Yoshua Bengio provides some very interesting comments and resources in response.
